## CAD(Computer-Aided Design for Digital Systems) Projects

1. CA1 
    * Review on logic design:
    * Implement Permutation func:
        * 1.phase one: design of controller and datapath on paper
        * 2.phase two: implement phase one with verilog
        
2. CA2 
    * Design for the Secure Hash Algorithm 3 (SHA-3):
    * Implement encoder func:
        * 1.phase one: design of controller and datapath on paper
        * 2.phase two: implement phase one with verilog

3. CA3
